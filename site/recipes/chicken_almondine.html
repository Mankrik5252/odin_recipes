    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken almondine is nothing more than dressed up simple chicken tenderloins with a buttery almond sauce. Just a few<br>
    pantry items will turn your chicken main dish into something special. There were two thumbs up from my guys, so I'm a<br>
    happy cook!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds chicken tenderloins</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2/3 cup plain panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>8 ounces spaghetti</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
            <li>6 small fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </p1>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Place chicken tenderloins between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with<br>
        the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/4-inch thickness. Lightly season chicken with salt and pepper.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Set up dredging stations by placing flour on a plate, then set a shallow bowl with beaten eggs beside it.<br>
        Finally,combine grated pecorino, Parmesan, and breadcrumbs on a plate at the third station.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>Dredge each tenderloin in flour, shaking off excess, then dip in egg, allowing excess to drip off. Place on top<br>
        of cheese and panko mixture, patting it into chicken until well coated. Set each piece on a plate until all are<br>
        dredged and breaded.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring<br>
    occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
    <p>Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until butter stops sizzling, then add breaded chicken<br>
    tenderloins, being careful not to overcrowd the skillet. You may want to cook chicken in batches.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
    <p>Cook tenderloins until nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center of<br>
    chicken pieces should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
    <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
    <p>Remove chicken from the skillet and place on a rack over a plate or tray and keep warm, until all tenderloins are done.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
    <p>Drain spaghetti, return to the pot, and stir in marinara. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until<br>
    spaghetti and sauce are hot, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 9</strong></p>
    <p>Evenly divide the tenderloins and spaghetti with marinara on four plates. Garnish with fresh parsley sprigs.</p>
